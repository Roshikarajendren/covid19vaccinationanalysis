## Introduction
This repository contains code for analyzing COVID-19 vaccine data. The analysis aims to provide insights into vaccine distribution, effectiveness, and related statistics.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for running the analysis notebooks)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn (for machine learning-based analysis, if applicable)
- [Data Source] - Provide a link or reference to where the data can be obtained.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Roshikarajendren/covid19-vaccine-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd covid19-vaccine-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Make sure you've downloaded the COVID-19 vaccine data and saved it in the appropriate data folder.

- If there are multiple analysis scripts or Jupyter notebooks, provide a brief description of each, and how to run them.

   ```
